## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I want to continue improving my skills in web development and found this great resource that emphasises learning through building hands-on projects. This first project was particularly useful for revising some concepts, while also familiarising myself with the platform. Moving forward, I'd focus more on improving responsiveness.
